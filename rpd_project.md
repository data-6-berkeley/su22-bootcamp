# Research, Pedagogy, and Discovery Group Project
{:.no_toc}

* TOC
{:toc}

## Overview
This summer seminar provide scholars an opportunity to explore independent projects early in their data scientist career. Scholars will build pedagogically and socially motivated curricula for a new introductory computing course centered around data and science.

Unlike a traditional open-ended research project, students will understand, explore, and reproduce existing contexts and findings of particular datasets; **through reproducibility**, students will build research skills and bridge interdisciplinary fields of study.

### Components
There are several components to this seminar:
1. **Scholars**{: .label .label-green} **Lecture series** on how to read semi-technical data science articles, consider ethical and social implications when studying a dataset, and do exploratory data analysis.

1. **Group**{: .label .label-blue} **Lab/group work series** where students build small pieces of curricula, including how to write a discussion question and write a lab question.

1. **Project**{: .label .label-yellow} **Project series**-based exploration of parts 1 and 2 in teams of 3-4 Tuskegee students + one Berkeley Data 6/Data 8 UGSI. Each group will focus on one social context.

1. **Scholars**{: .label .label-purple} **Lecture series** Thriving in STEM (run by SEED Scholars Summer Rising Program).

### Learning Goals and Workload

After this seminar, scholars will have exposure to the following:

* How to read data science articles
* How to consider ethical and social implications when studying a dataset
* How to do Exploratory Data Analysis
* How to write a discussion question
* How to write a lab question

We expect there to be little commitment outside of the scheduled 4 group work hours + 4-6 scholars-only hours.

## [Project 1] Reading Data Science Literature

### Discussion Readings
{:.no_toc}

List 2-3 readings accessible to a student audience that will illuminate a particular dataset in the context of society. The readings should describe the topic itself, the current public opinion, any historical context, and a recent research study using the dataset.

### Discussion Question 1: Information Recall
{:.no_toc}

Pose a discussion question that encourages students to discuss what they learned from the above readings. In addition, write a lesson plan for an instructor that includes the main takeaway point for students from this exercise.

### Submission
{:.no_toc}

Google Slides with at least 5 slides:
* History of the topic
* Current public opinion
* Research example
* Discussion question
* Lesson plan

## [Presentation] Mid-Point Presentation, Scholars only
* Present Project 1
* And a visualization from Exploratory Data Analysis

## [Project 2] Social and Ethical Implications of Data

### Discussion Question 2: Social and Behavioral Science Methodology
{:.no_toc}

Pick 3-4 variables in the dataset and describe its conceptualization (from concept to variable definition) and operationalization (measurement and data collection).

### Discussion Question 3: Ethics and implications of responsibility
{:.no_toc}

How were the data collectors/scientists connected to the population of interest? How may the historical context have impacted the data collection, reports, and policy decisions?

### Lesson plan details
{:.no_toc}

Describe particular norms an instructor should establish during this discussion, and what role the discussion facilitator should play. Are there any key terms a student should remember? How can an instructor guide the conversation away from criticism and towards constructive design?

### *Optional Readings*
{:.no_toc}

TBD

## [Project 3] Constructing computing problems

Build a Jupyter notebook that has both the question/skeleton code and solutions for the two exercises below.

### Checkpoint
Identify the core library function and the core computation concept respectively for the two exercises below.

### Lab Exercise 1: The `datascience` Module
{:.no_toc}

Use 1-2 datascience module functions to construct a plot that demonstrates a facet of the data in the context of the findings from readings/discussion activities.

### Lab Exercise 2: A computational problem
{:.no_toc}

Compute a rate, proportion, or statistic that uses loops and/or conditional statements that demonstrates a facet of the data in the context of the findings from readings/discussion activities.
