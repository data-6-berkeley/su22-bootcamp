# Research, Pedagogy, and Discovery Group Project
{:.no_toc}

* TOC
{:toc}

## Overview
This summer seminar provide scholars an opportunity to explore independent projects early in their data scientist career. Scholars will build pedagogically and socially motivated curricula for a new introductory computing course centered around data and science.

Unlike a traditional open-ended research project, students will understand, explore, and reproduce existing contexts and findings of particular datasets; **through reproducibility**, students will build research skills and bridge interdisciplinary fields of study.

### Components
There are several components to this seminar:
1. **Scholars**{: .label .label-green} **Lecture series** on how to read semi-technical data science articles, consider ethical and social implications when studying a dataset, and do exploratory data analysis.

1. **Group**{: .label .label-blue} **Lab/group work series** where students build small pieces of curricula, including how to write a discussion question and write a lab question.

1. **Project**{: .label .label-yellow} **Project series**-based exploration of parts 1 and 2 in teams of 3-4 Tuskegee students + one Berkeley Data 6/Data 8 UGSI. Each group will focus on one social context.

1. **Scholars**{: .label .label-purple} **Lecture series** Thriving in STEM (run by SEED Scholars Summer Rising Program).

### Learning Goals and Workload

After this seminar, scholars will have exposure to the following:

* How to read data science articles
* How to consider ethical and social implications when studying a dataset
* How to do Exploratory Data Analysis
* How to write a discussion question
* How to write a lab question

We expect there to be little commitment outside of the scheduled 4 group work hours + 4-6 scholars-only hours.

### Deliverable: Google Slides
{:.no_toc}

Your Google Slide deck should have at least the following:

* Slide: History of the topic
* Slide: Current public opinion
* Slide: Research example
* Slide: Bio of a prominent researcher in the field at the intersection of society and data science
* Slide: Lesson plan for discussion activity

**These slides will not be presented anywhere!** The slides format is just to organize your thoughts. Feel free to add slides as necessary.

### Lesson Plan for Discussion Activity

Outline a 15-minute introductory discussion that encourages students to discuss what they learned from the above readings. In addition, write a lesson plan for an instructor that includes the main takeaway point for students from this exercise. Discussion will be 50 minutes total, so this is the opening 1/4th of class. There should be several parts of this lesson:

* Reading list for students
* Lesson plan (see below):
    * How will you introduce the discussion section?
    * How will you structure the discussion of the question(s)? In groups, pairs, as a class? Will you have time to review as a class?
    * Share the main takeaway you will repeat for the students at the end of activity.

To answer the above, you should present a slide addressing the following table:

| Category | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Student Required Readings** | Pick at most 3 readings that students should read prior to discussion that will illuminate a particular dataset in the context of society. This may be a subset of the ones we provided, or you can pick your own from reputable sources.<br/>The readings should describe the topic itself, the current public opinion, any historical context, and a recent research study using the dataset.<br/>Readings should take about 1 hour, maximum. |
| **Introduction**<br/>(5 minutes) | How will you introduce the discussion section? |
| **Recall Activity**<br/>(10 minutes) | Pose a question you to get students positioned and warmed up to discuss. It often involves students “recalling” what was in their required readings. | 
| **Activity structure** | How will you structure the discussion of this question(s)? In small groups, pairs, as a class? Will you have time to review as a class before or after the activity? |
| **Learning Goal/Outcome** | Write a sentence for the instructor-facing lesson plan, e.g., “By the end of this activity, students will be able to…” |
| **Main Takeaway**<br/>(2 minutes) | Share the main student-facing takeaway that you will repeat for the students at the end of activity. | 

### Submission

Send the Google Slides through Slack.

## [Project 2] Social and Ethical Implications of Data

### Discussion Question 2: Social and Behavioral Science Methodology
{:.no_toc}

Pick 3-4 variables in the dataset and describe its conceptualization (from concept to variable definition) and operationalization (measurement and data collection).

### Discussion Question 3: Ethics and implications of responsibility
{:.no_toc}

How were the data collectors/scientists connected to the population of interest? How may the historical context have impacted the data collection, reports, and policy decisions?

### Lesson plan details
{:.no_toc}

Describe particular norms an instructor should establish during this discussion, and what role the discussion facilitator should play. Are there any key terms a student should remember? How can an instructor guide the conversation away from criticism and towards constructive design?

### *Optional Readings*
